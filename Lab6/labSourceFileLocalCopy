It's a small world, it's a small world
It's a small world, it's a small world

It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all

It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world

There is just one moon and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains be wide and the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all

It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small world

It's a small world after all, no matter if you're big or small
Come on everybody let's bounce to this
Let's play some love with a little twist
It's a small world, it's a small world

It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hope and a world of fears
There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all, it's a small world

It's a small world after all
(After all, everybody now)
It's a small world after all
(After all, can you hear me now?)

It's a small world after all
(Come on, come on)
It's a small, small, small, small world
It's a small world, after all
(After all, everybody now)

It's a small world after all
(After all)
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small, small, small world

It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world
It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all
It's a small world after all, it's a small, small, small, small world
